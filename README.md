# Welcome to My Linear Regression
***

## Task
The problems were in optimizing the function and finding the gradient
For me, the challenge was higher mathematics
## Description
I watched various videos, studied how it works, but looked at kaggle how other guys solved this problem

## Installation
I'm not going to put this project on github yet, because it's not full, I'll work on this project again. I ran into a lot of problems

## Usage
We simply find the most optimal line or function thanks to Python and mathematical calculations.
```
./my_project argument1 argument2
```
